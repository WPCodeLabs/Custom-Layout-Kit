# Custom Layout Kit

Custom Layout Kit is a WordPress plugin that takes advantage of popular theme and plugin hooks to inject content anywhere. From simple global elements, to complex conditionals, you have complete control.

CKL supports both Beaver Builder and Elementor page builders, as well as the WordPress block and classic editors, allowing you to design your custom layouts your way. Take Beaver Builder and Elementor outside of the content area!

## Features

* Attach your custom layouts to action hooks in your themes and plugins.
* Display layouts within widgets and with a handy shortcode.
* Conditionally display the templates on the desired pages, with both simple and complex display rules.
* Extend the action hooks for any theme with simple filters!

## Important!

Custom Layout Kit is designed as a premium plugin. There will be a 'lite' version in the WordPress repository in the future.

Custom Layout Kit utilizes Advanced Custom Fields PRO, and as a premium plugin will be distributed with that functionality with a valid license. However, since this repository is for active development, ACF Pro has been ignored. If you want to contribute to development, you will have to install a copy of ACF pro in the vendor directory, or have an existing copy of ACF Pro activated in WordPress.
